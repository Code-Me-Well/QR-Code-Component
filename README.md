## My Process

### BUilt With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

As my first foray into the world of web development, this project has been an invaluable learning experience. The opportunity to hone my GitHub skills has been a major highlight for me, and I've thoroughly enjoyed the process. While this is my first project using HTML, I felt confident in my abilities and it didn't significantly impact my overall programming experience.

### Continued development

This project has solidified my commitment to prioritize responsive design in my future web development endeavors. I'm particularly passionate about further refining my Flexbox skills, and I'm excited to apply my diffrent ways to tackle the same problems with fresh perspectives in my upcoming projects.
